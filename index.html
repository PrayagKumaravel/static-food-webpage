                <p>Tamil Nadu is a southern Indian state that has a
                    remarkably rich cultural legacy. The people of
                    Tamil Nadu are members of the famous Dravidian
                    Family, which is regarded as one of the oldest
                    civilizations in the world. Tamilians take great
                    pleasure in their deeply ingrained culture and
                    work very hard to preserve their 2000-year-old
                    heritage, much like other South Indians do.
                    The state has prospered since it was controlled
                    by the Cholas, Pandyas, and Pallavas.
                    They produced the architecture and art that
                    are still in use and maintained today.
                    The Tamil Nadu cuisine offers a wide range of
                    dishes to choose from. Tamilians eat a variety
                    of rice dishes as their main source of food.
                    In the state, rice is prepared in a variety
                    of ways, from the common plain rice to other
                    rice variations including lemon rice, Thakkali
                    Soru (tomato rice), Thengai Soru (coconut rice),
                    and Paruppu Soru (lentil rice). Some of the most
                    popular side dishes in the state are Idly-Sambar, Sambar,
                    Rasam, and Coconut Chutney. Along with dosing
                    , uttapam, a dish similar to the dosa but with
                    tomatoes and other spices, is a typical breakfast
                    food in the state.

                <p>Kerala is known to have several mythical as well as historical facts about its origin. In fact, the
                    earliest written records are dated as back as the 2nd and the 4th century BC. Its strategic location
                    at the southern tip of India, nestled very close to the Malabar Coast, has attracted several
                    explorers to Kerala.The very act or preparing or cooking a meal is known as pachakam in Malayalam,
                    the local language of Kerala. The food items have a distinct flavour of spices and of course, the
                    coconut!Sea food is a staple diet, along with beef, pork, poultry and mutton in the non-vegetarian
                    sections. Karimeen or the pearl spotted fish is a rare and expensive fish here. Its delicious and
                    tastes fantastic as a fry or a curry form. Seer fish, nanga, cuttle fish, king fish etc are other
                    popular favourites here. Rice, coconut and curry leaves are omnipresent in almost every Keralite
                    dish. The rice consumed in
                    traditional Keralite homes is the unpolished rice. It's considered healthier, as its original fibres
                    are retained.
